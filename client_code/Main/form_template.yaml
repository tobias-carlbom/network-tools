          <p>
              I'm Tobias Carlbom, a software developer working with companies in the automation sector.
              I build custom software for production environments—collecting data, visualizing processes,
              enabling remote access, and integrating systems like databases, SCADA, and ERP.
          </p>

          <h2>Examples of what I've built</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Logging applications for production data.</li>
              <li>Dashboards for operators and managers.</li>
              <li>VPN solutions for industrial trucks and off-grid sites.</li>
              <li>Label printing systems for production.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
              I work across a wide range of technologies and choose what fits your situation.
              I'm not tied to any vendor or platform, so my recommendations are based on what actually works for you.
          </p>

          <p>
              When I take on a project, I see it through. I focus on understanding what you need
              and will deliver a solution that works reliably.
          </p>
